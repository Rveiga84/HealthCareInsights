# Health Insurance Analysis

## Introduction
This project aims to analyze health insurance data to understand the factors affecting insurance charges. The analysis revolves around understanding the impact of age, BMI, and smoking habits on insurance charges.

## Key Findings
1. **Age Trend**: Older individuals generally face higher insurance charges.
2. **Smoking Impact**: Smokers consistently have higher insurance charges across all age and BMI groups.
3. **BMI Insights**: The Obese category witnesses the highest insurance charges among all BMI groups, especially when combined with smoking habits.

## Predictive Model
I also developed a predictive model to forecast insurance charges based on a person's age, BMI, and smoking status. This model can help insurance companies in setting premium values for new customers.

## Visualizations
Three key visualizations were developed:
- Distribution of Age
- Distribution of BMI
- Distribution of Insurance Charges
